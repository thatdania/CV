# I’m that Dania, logically and literally.
I am the Dania, out of many Dania’s who have broken the Asian stereotype and 
thus, explores the world for her passion of animation & design. I am also branded
as “thatdania”, an onward GIF scientist / Animator/ Medium Blogger/ Front-end 
Developer/Youtuber/ the slashes will go on.

My endearing drive and energetic behaviour inspires my mantra of
breaking conventions alongside with uniting others to do so. Whether
it is indulging my belief of how GIFS are the trending future of graphic
design, forming the first ‘Standard Operating Procedure’ of how to run
the infamous Central Saint Martins’s Degree Show or exploring the
possibilities of design in the tech world, my approach below, always remains.

> ~"What more conventions or limits can we break together than if we did it alone?"

Although I am a recent CSM graduate and currently studying at
Makers Academy, I wish to be part of a community where design
and code are simultaneously being fleshed out together.
I hope to work in a flourishing environment where commonly
**everyone wants to break a convention.**

## What I am known for

**Visionary**

In progress of curating the CSM’s Degree Show, I developed a strong
vision of breaking the convention that all four pathways in Graphic
Design should be segregated and not have an equal say. It developed
my ability to lead the curation for the show, gathering 20 students
from all pathways in my tiny dorm room to strategise and negotiate
with how the show should be displayed so that majority of the 
community could be expressed equally in the show.

**Self-Starter**

When it was my community’s turn to host 2017 CSM’s Degree Show, I
stepped up to be the project manager for the community’s show.I
gathered a head team of students to delegate tasks, documented
all the meetings, motivated for progress and solved problems for
each team and developed a strong “communicator role” between the
staff and students. The whole experience challenged me to drive for
roles I had never done before.

**Venturesome**

In May 2017, I participated in a App Design-Sprint workshop
hosted by the BBC. The goal was to flesh out an App that impacts
an important change. Teams tackled topics such as fighting against
fake news or filtering politics. However, my team’s idea was to
make an app that protected one’s identity and actions when one
was drunk. As I contributed the idea, creatively pushed my team
to execute the idea and sell the idea, the coaches from the BBC 
surprisingly loved the app and thought the overall app was a success.

**Fast Learner & “Do-er”**

On the 9th week at Makers Academy, my team had the challenge of building a Battle Game with React within a week.
 Individually, we learnt React in less than 48 hours and successfully implemented a presentable game. My contribution
 was writing React code whilst pair programming and also implementing the CSS, HTML and the design through React. You
 can explore the project [here](https://github.com/thatdania/Trangressions)

**Technical Skills:**
- Adobe Suite (Illustrator, After Effects, InDesign, Photoshop, Premiere, Lightroom, XD)
- Coding (Javascript, CSS, HTML, basics of REACT, Ruby, SQL)
- Stop Motion (Dragon Frame, Rostrum, Rotroscoping)
- Google (Word, Excel, Slides, Drive)
