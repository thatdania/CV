# Dania Mah
I’m that Dania, logically and literally. I am that Dania, out of many Danias’ who has broke the Asian stereotype and thus, explores the world for her passion of animation & design. I am also that Dania, branded as “thatdania”, an onward GIF scientist / Animator/ Medium Blogger/ Front-end Developer/Youtuber/ the slashes will go on. 

My endearing drive and energetic behavior inspires my mantra of breaking conventions alongside uniting others. Whether it is proving my belief of the GIF’S future through collaborative projects or forming a first SOP for the infamous Central Saint Martin’s Degree show, my approach is always

> "how can we achieve something more compared to if we each did it individually"

Although I am a recent graduate of CSM and currently studying code at Makers Academy, I wish to be part of a design studio possibly where code is being fleshed out alongside with it. I hope to work in a flourishing environment where commonly, **everyone wants to break a convention.**
