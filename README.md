# I‚Äôm that Dania, logically and literally.

I'm thatDania, logically and literally. I'm the Dania, out of many Dania's who ventured out of Malaysia 
to discover her passions for design and technology. I'm also known as "thatdania" who is an ongoing Web Developer, 
Animator, Designer, Hackernoon Blogger and GIF Scientist.

My endearing drive and energetic behaviour fuels my nature of an explorer. Whether it is diving deep to learn
new technologies, leading 150 students of the infamous Central Saint Martin's Degree Show or indulging others, 
including myself that GIFS are the trending future of graphic design, this mindset is my secret to these enriching 
accomplishments as given any explorer needs the following qualities. To be constantly curious, unafraid of venturing
into the unknown and most importantly, to be proactive with discovering what I'm passionate about (code and design).

As I am growing to be a Web Developer, I wish to be amongst a community who values good craftmanship in code, 
well designed applications that are focused on enhancing the user's engagement and supported learning.Ideally, I would
like to be in a flourishing enviroment where everyone **is an explorer.**

## What I am known for

**Visionary**

In progress of curating the CSM‚Äôs Degree Show, I had this strong
vision of breaking the convention that all four pathways in Graphic
Design should be equally contribute and be displayed in the show. This bravely made me
take on the curation role, a role I hadn't done by gathering 20 students
from all pathways in my tiny dorm room. I lead the team to strategise how the show 
should be curated and how majority of the community could participate to help effectively with
the show.

**Self-Starter**

Whilst building my final week project at Makers Acadmey, I volunteered to do additional documentation
for our project along with designing the product. This included writing blogs about our process, 
about how the code works, ideating the design theme, doing mock-ups of the layout and designing all the icons. 
I played a large role for the interface and documentation for our project, MemoMap. You can explore MemoMap: [here](https://github.com/tmerrr/map-app) and the blogs: [here](https://hackernoon.com/episode-43-the-art-of-setting-up-a-mern-stack-final-project-week-d554bffe2c0e)

**Venturesome**

In May 2017, I participated in a App Design-Sprint workshop
hosted by the BBC. The goal was to flesh out an App that impacts
an important change. Teams tackled topics such as fighting against
fake news or filtering politics. However, my team‚Äôs idea was to
make an app that protected one‚Äôs identity and actions when one
was drunk. As I contributed the idea, creatively pushed my team
to execute the idea and took a risk, the coaches from the BBC 
surprisingly loved the app and thought the overall app was a success.

**Fast Learner & ‚ÄúDo-er‚Äù**

On the 9th week at Makers Academy, my team had the challenge of building a Battle Game with React within a week.
 Individually, we learnt React in less than 48 hours and successfully implemented a presentable game. My contribution
 was writing React code whilst pair programming and also implementing the CSS, HTML and the design through React. You
 can explore the project [here](https://github.com/thatdania/Trangressions)

- Coding Practices (DRY, TDD, CRUD) 
- Adobe Suite (Illustrator, After Effects, InDesign, Photoshop, Premiere, Lightroom, XD)
